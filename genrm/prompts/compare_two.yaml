# Idea is to use this to compare the outputs from two runs.

  You will be given a math problem followed by two solutions, including their reasoning traces. The solutions will be referred by Solution A and Solution B. Your task is to reason over the two solutions, and identify if any of the solutions is correct. Note that the reasoning process in the solutions can have intermediate errors, but as long as the solution is able to identify and backtrack/recover from those errors, consider the solution as correct. 

  YOUR TASK

  Problem: {problem}
  Solution A: {solution_a}
  Solution B: {solution_b}

  Provide your reasoning and end the response with one of the appropriate judgements out of the following four:
  - "Judgement: Both the solutions are correct"
  - "Judgement: Only solution A is correct"
  - "Judgement: Only solution B is correct"
  - "Judgement: Both the solutions are incorrect"

  Do not end the response with anything else other than these four options.
