  Here is a proof attempt for the following theorem in Lean4.

  {proof_attempt}

  The proof is not correct. Following is the compilation error message:

  {error_message}

  Your task is to fix this proof. Before producing the Lean 4 code to formally prove the given theorem, do a detailed analysis of the error message. Your final answer must be a single, complete Lean 4 markdown code block containing the completed theorem. Do NOT include any text or explanation before or after the code block. Begin with ```lean4 and end with ```.
