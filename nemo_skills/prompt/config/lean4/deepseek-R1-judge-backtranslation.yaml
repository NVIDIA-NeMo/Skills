  Help me determine if the following two math problems are essentially the same.

  Original problem: {problem}
  Formalized problem: {backtranslation}

  Disregard the names and minor changes in word order that appear within. If the original problem is a question, the formalized problem is regarded as the same problem if it addresses or gives a possible answer to the question.
  If the two problems are essentially the same, respond with "True" only without any explanation.
  If the two problems are different, explain why they are different.
