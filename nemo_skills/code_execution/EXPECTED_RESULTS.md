# Expected Results for LeanInteractSession Examples

This document outlines the expected results for the guaranteed working examples in the LeanInteractSession tool.

## 🎯 Guaranteed Working Examples

These examples are designed to work in **any** Lean 4 setup, regardless of imports or configuration:

### 1. **Proving True**
```lean
theorem test_true : True := by trivial
```
**Expected Result:**
- `success`: `True`
- `proof_complete`: `True`
- `error`: `None`
- **Why it works**: `True` is a built-in proposition that `trivial` can always prove

### 2. **Reflexivity**
```lean
theorem test_rfl (n : ℕ) : n = n := by rfl
```
**Expected Result:**
- `success`: `True`
- `proof_complete`: `True`
- `error`: `None`
- **Why it works**: Reflexivity of equality is always available and `rfl` proves it

### 3. **Basic Arithmetic**
```lean
theorem test_arith : 1 + 1 = 2 := by norm_num
```
**Expected Result:**
- `success`: `True`
- `proof_complete`: `True`
- `error`: `None`
- **Why it works**: `norm_num` can compute basic arithmetic expressions

### 4. **Definitional Equality**
```lean
theorem test_def (n : ℕ) : 0 + n = n := by rfl
```
**Expected Result:**
- `success`: `True`
- `proof_complete`: `True`
- `error`: `None`
- **Why it works**: `0 + n = n` is definitionally equal (true by definition)

## 📊 What Success Looks Like

When you run the guaranteed examples, you should see:

```
=== Guaranteed Working Proofs ===

--- Test 1: Proving True ---
'trivial' for True: success=True, complete=True
✅ Proof: theorem test_true : True := by
  trivial

--- Test 2: Reflexivity ---
'rfl' for n = n: success=True, complete=True
✅ Proof: theorem test_rfl (n : ℕ) : n = n := by
  rfl

--- Test 3: Basic arithmetic ---
'norm_num' for 1+1=2: success=True, complete=True
✅ Proof: theorem test_arithmetic : 1 + 1 = 2 := by
  norm_num

--- Test 4: Definitional equality ---
'rfl' for 0+n=n: success=True, complete=True
✅ Proof: theorem test_def_eq (n : ℕ) : 0 + n = n := by
  rfl

🎯 Summary: 4/4 guaranteed proofs succeeded
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Failed Tests

If any of these guaranteed examples fail, it indicates a problem with your setup:

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Lean 4 Not Installed**
   - Error: `lean: command not found`
   - Solution: Install Lean 4 via elan

2. **Wrong Lean Version**
   - Error: Syntax errors or unknown tactics
   - Solution: Update to Lean 4 (v4.0.0+)

3. **Path Issues**
   - Error: Cannot find lean executable
   - Solution: Ensure `lean` is in your PATH

4. **Permission Issues**
   - Error: Cannot create temporary files
   - Solution: Check write permissions in temp directory

### **Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Lean Installation:**
   ```bash
   lean --version
   # Should show: Lean (version 4.x.x, ...)
   ```

2. **Test Basic Lean:**
   ```bash
   echo "theorem test : True := by trivial" > test.lean
   lean test.lean
   # Should compile without errors
   ```

3. **Check Python Environment:**
   ```python
   from nemo_skills.code_execution.lean_interact_session import create_lean_interact_session
   # Should import without errors
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once the guaranteed examples work:

1. **Try More Complex Proofs**: Move to theorems requiring multiple tactics
2. **Test Branching**: Use the advanced branching features
3. **Integrate with Your Workflow**: Use in batch processing or interactive development
4. **Add Custom Tactics**: Extend with domain-specific tactics

## 📝 Expected Performance

- **Execution Time**: Each guaranteed proof should complete in < 5 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (< 100MB per session)
- **Success Rate**: 100% for guaranteed examples
- **Cleanup**: No temporary files should remain after session.cleanup()

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your LeanInteractSession setup is working correctly when:
- All 4 guaranteed proofs succeed
- No elan warnings appear in error fields (filtered out)
- Generated proof scripts are syntactically correct
- Session cleanup completes without errors

If you see these results, your Lean 4 setup is properly configured and ready for advanced proof development!
